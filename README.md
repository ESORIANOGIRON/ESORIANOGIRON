Hi there,

I'm an spanish native speaking engineer with spanish-german speaking kids. This year my elder son was very interested in English words, numbers and a Bingo game he found at the school. This is the result of some half an hour sessions in QtCreator, stolen from my weekends, so that we can enjoy a little English, numbers and luck during rainy (or too sunny) evenings.
